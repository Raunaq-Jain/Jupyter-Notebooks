## Problem Statement
###### A model needs to be build that can *Classify* or *Detect* images in the labeled logo class. In case of resources' availability no need "train your model" n number of times.

## Submission
###### Entire model/code needs to be submitted.

## Evaluation
###### Will be based on model developed. "*Detection*" would be an added advantage.

### Note:
*If you have anything in mind feel free to reach us @gulshan@vidooly.com or post any issue; but donot forget to tag 'LOGO'.*
